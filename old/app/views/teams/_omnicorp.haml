%p If you were to plot the philosophies of each team on a line, with one side for the serious racers and the other for knee slapping absurdism, Omni Corp Detroit would occupy that corner that is the exact opposite of Sector 67. What more could you possibly ask for from a hackerspace that shows up to a racing series with a rolling tiki bar? Their barely movable chicane from 2011 was updated considerably with a full fledged roof, disco ball, more car stereos and a complimentary toolbox full of PBR. They also armed their pit crew with tshirt cannons and confetti bombs. 
%p The real crowd pleaser though was the slightly faster secondary car, because it was a giant puppy. Puppy Car proceeded to charm the crap out of the bewildered Detroit audience all the while lifting its cute little felt leg and peeing on families. What was even more exciting was the nigh-unthinkable 4th place it scored in the Detroit Endurance race. OCD is not a team that is accustomed to finishing races, let alone performing admirably well in them. But here it was: the single weirdest thing of what ever to grace the track, and it was beating the "better" three quarters of a field in a race that defines mechanical ingenuity. What more could you expect a team to do to shock the establishment? Well played Omni Corp, well played.
