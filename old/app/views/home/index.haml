      %p Engineering, technology, diversity, and above all imagination are at the core of what we represent. We believe that sharing open source knowledge, tools, and tech among inspired makers of all ages and abilities will unlock the solutions to some of the most difficult challenges we face today. The challenge of creating a working electric vehicle for under $500 encourages progressive use of available technology and inspires our teams to help each other, even in the spirit of competition. Above all else, we believe that anyone with the passion and drive to learn will help lead us into the future.

      %h2 BUILD
      %p Never welded before? No problem. Not sure which one is the wrench and which one is the screwdriver? We can help you with that. Electronics a mysterious jumble of lights and sounds? Well, it’s time to learn what those lights and sounds do. This is a series made for the motivated beginner. After all, races are more fun when everyone gets to share in our collective fiery mistakes. Queue up your Youtube account with some how-to videos, grab some friends, find the tool kit, invite your niece who’s been playing with Goldie Blox since last summer, buy yourself a full-face helmet, and get to work!

      %h2 COMPETE
      %p Start with $500 and a Power Wheel. (Or any electric kids’ ride on vehicle.) Get some new batteries. A new motor. Heck, some nice new tires. Tie LEDs to the hood. Sprinkle it with glitter. Maybe a feather for class. Haul it to one of our many races, the locations of which are detailed below. Put it on the track. Race it with other cars for glory and trophies. Laugh, cry, jump in the air, get sprayed with sparkling cider (I mean, this is an all-ages show), put out a fire or two. Have a literal blast. And do it all while learning, sharing tools and technology with your competitors, and pleasing a crowd full of cheering, adoring fans.

        %h2 Why?
        %p
          We believe in the power of sharing knowledge, tools, and tech among inspired people of all ages and abilities. We believe that crowd sourced research and development will be the solution to some of the most difficult challenges our society faces today -- transportation, renewable energy, viable education for our technological world. Most of all, we believe that ordinary people, students, hackerspaces, and small start ups will lead us into the future. 
        %p 
          Through our innovative racing series, we make engineering entertaining and approachable. We work to advance technology education and encourage people to try something new.
      .span6
        %h2 What is it?
        %p
          We run an annual racing series in which small teams from all over the country strip down and build up kids' power wheels cars and race them on a specially designed track for hundreds of cheering fans. The challenge -- to create a working electric vehicle for less than $500 using open source tools and tech -- encourages progressive use of available technology and inspires our teams to help each other, even in the spirit of lighthearted competition. We believe these inventive creations will eventually inspire the street legal electric vehicles of our future.
        %p
          We are the Power Racing Series, and we want you to help us change the world.
